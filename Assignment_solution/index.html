            <h3 class="h1">Chicken</h3>
            Beef, chicken and pork are the most menued meats, says a recent report from Mintel on "Meat Preparations and Trends."The reports notes that more complex techniques increase opportunities for value-add menu copy, such as concepts like “fire-seared,” “fork-tender,” “braised for hours,” and “smothered." Slow-cooked meats have proven popular; not only are they convenient, versatile and a value-add for restaurants, they are also perceived by consumers as an healthier option than burgers and fries.
